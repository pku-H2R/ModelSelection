# Getting Started 

**Francois Chollet  :  The current landscape of machine learning algorithms: gradient boosting machines for shallow learning problems; and deep learning for perceptual problems.**
**No Free Lunch: If you make absolutely no assumption about the data, then there is no reason to prefer one model over any other.**
